# DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
List of options to solve "django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings."

I like sane defaults. 

If there is no sane default, then I am unsure and create a list of options.

Here is a list of options on how to solve this exception, which is well known in the context of the django web framework.
